# Book tracking app

This is a copy of the full stack application I made that acts as a place to store books you have read.
You can also give your books a rating.

Users can signup and access their own books through Firebase. In the original application I practiced with the MERN stack, writing API routes, validations, authentication checks and error handling.

I wanted to make this one too as a clone to again practice using Firebase BaaS but also to have a deployed version of the app.

## Tech used

Firebase Auth and Firestorage.
React useReducer and useContext for global storage on the frontend. React useEffect and useState hooks throughout for handling API calls.
